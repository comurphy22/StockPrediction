## 🔬 Experiment Notes

**Hypothesis:** Model trained on 2018-2019 data will show predictive value for financials and healthcare stocks in 2025.

**Early Results (Trade #1):**
- ✅ WFC prediction worked (+0.98%)
- Validates historical 70% accuracy
- Suggests model generalizes to current market

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Does win rate match validation results (~60-70% for financials)?
2. Do confidence levels predict accuracy?
3. How does performance vary by sector?
4. What's the economic value after transaction costs?
